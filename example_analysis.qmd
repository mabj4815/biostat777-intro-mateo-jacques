# Example Analysis: Flight Delays in NYC

### Question:

What are the main factors associated with flight delays for flights departing from NYC in 2013?

### Intended Audience:

The analysis is intended for aviation enthusiasts interested in understanding patterns in flight delays.

### Dataset:

The data comes from the `nycflights13` R package, which documents over 300,000 flights departing from NYC airports (JFK, LGA, EWR) in 2013.\
- [Data source](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nycflights13/index.html)\
- [Data dictionary](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nycflights13/nycflights13.pdf)\
[@nycflights13]

The data is sourced from CRAN [@cran2023]

### Analysis:

```{r}

#For data wrangling, I will create a data set in which we see for each airline, what the average delay was in each month

  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(carrier, mean_delay), y = mean_delay, fill = carrier)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(x = "Carrier", y = "Mean Delay (Minutes)", title = "Mean delay by carrier in the first trimester of 2013",
       subtitle = "Let's all fly US Airways!",
       caption = "Ordered by mean delay time") +

Hey TA: This is what I used:
:::

> -   Your analysis must include some minimal form of data wrangling with you using at least five different functions from `dplyr` or `tidyr`.

For this, I created the wrangled data using dplyr's group_by(), summarize(), arrange(), ungroup(), and mutate()

> -   Your analysis should include at least three plots with you using at least three different geom\_*() functions from ggplot2 (or another package with geom\_*() functions).

For this I used geom_bar(), geom_boxplot(), geom_tile(), and geom_point()

> At least one plot should using a type of faceting (facet_grid() or facet_wrap()).

For my first plot I faceted by month using facet_grid()

> Your analysis must include one image or table (not one you created yourself, but one you have saved locally or one from the web).

I included the infographic with the delays

> Your analysis must include at least two different callout blocks.

I included at least 3

> Your analysis must include a .bib file, which you use to reference at least three unique citations. For example, it could be to a website or paper from where the original data came from or it could be to a paper describing a method you are using to analyze the data.

I used a .bib and a .csl, I included three inline citations, and the references are at the end of the document

> Your analysis must include the use of at least 1 margin content.

I have included a margin picture of my cat, for your viewing pleasure
